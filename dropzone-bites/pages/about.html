  <article>
    <p data-i18n="about.p1">
      DropZone Bites is a unique platform created for skydiving enthusiasts who
      care not only about altitude, but also about what fuels their next jump.
    </p>

    <p data-i18n="about.p2">
      The idea was born from the everyday challenges of jumpers at airfields:
      long waits, unpredictable schedules, and limited access to healthy meals.
      This platform provides quick, practical recipes and logbook tools tailored
      to this lifestyle.
    </p>

    <p data-i18n="about.p3">
      Whether you're a first-time tandem flyer or a seasoned skydiver, DropZone
      Bites is here to offer you fuel, inspiration, and a growing community.
    </p>

      project by Takács Kristóf, combining his passions for skydiving, cooking,
      and digital product design.
